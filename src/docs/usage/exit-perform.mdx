## When to use EXIT PERFORM?

    1000-COBOL-SEARCH SECTION.
      MOVE 'WIDGET' TO WS-SEARCH-VALUE  
      MOVE 0 TO WS-INDEX  
      PERFORM 999999999 TIMES        *> Endless inline perform
        ADD 1 TO WS-INDEX  
        IF WS-INDEX > WS-ARRAY-SIZE  *> Avoid array overflow  
          DISPLAY "Reached end of array. None found."  
          EXIT PERFORM               *> Exit inline perform  
        END-IF  
        IF WS-ARRAY(WS-INDEX) = WS-SEARCH-VALUE *> Search text  
          DISPLAY "Value found!"  
          EXIT PERFORM               *> Mission accomplished.
        END-IF  
        IF WS-ARRAY(WS-INDEX) = SPACES   *> No more values  
          DISPLAY "Reached end of array values. None found."  
          EXIT PERFORM                   *> Exit inline perform  
        END-IF  
      END-PERFORM
      .
    1000-EXIT.
      EXIT.  


## What's the story?

The above COBOL code searches in an array, serially.  It stops 
searching when the desired text is found, or when it reached an
empty array element, or when it reached the end of the array.

As of November 2020, inline perform maximum times limit is 999999999.


## How about GO TO?
If your shop is not strict, here is the GO TO equivalent of the algorithm:

    1000-COBOL-SEARCH SECTION.
      MOVE 'WIDGET' TO WS-SEARCH-VALUE  
      MOVE 0 TO WS-INDEX  
      PERFORM 999999999 TIMES        *> Endless inline perform
        ADD 1 TO WS-INDEX  
        IF WS-INDEX > WS-ARRAY-SIZE  *> Avoid array overflow  
          DISPLAY "Reached end of array. None found."  
          GO TO 1000-EXIT            *> Exit section
        END-IF  
        IF WS-ARRAY(WS-INDEX) = WS-SEARCH-VALUE *> Search text  
          DISPLAY "Value found!"     *> Mission accomplished.
          GO TO 1000-EXIT            *> Exit section
        END-IF  
        IF WS-ARRAY(WS-INDEX) = SPACES   *> No more values  
          DISPLAY "Reached end of array values. None found."  
          GO TO 1000-EXIT            *> Exit section  
        END-IF  
      END-PERFORM  
      .
    1000-EXIT.
      EXIT.  



## How about nested IFs?
Absolutely, but it is my least favorite.  I think it is harder
to do a 100% coverage testing and harder to do future code 
revisions - like adding a couple more nested IFs or compound conditions.

    1000-COBOL-SEARCH SECTION.
      MOVE 'WIDGET' TO WS-SEARCH-VALUE  
      MOVE 0 TO WS-INDEX  
      SET END-OF-LOOP TO FALSE
      PERFORM UNTIL END-OF-LOOP              *> Loop indicator flag
        ADD 1 TO WS-INDEX  
        IF WS-INDEX > WS-ARRAY-SIZE          *> Avoid array overflow  
          DISPLAY "Reached end of array. None found."  
          SET END-OF-LOOP TO TRUE            *> Exit loop
        ELSE  
          IF WS-ARRAY(WS-INDEX) = WS-SEARCH-VALUE *> Search text  
            DISPLAY "Value found!"           *> Mission accomplished.
            SET END-OF-LOOP TO TRUE          *> Exit loop
          ELSE  
            IF WS-ARRAY(WS-INDEX) = SPACES   *> No more values  
              DISPLAY "Reached end of array values. None found."  
              SET END-OF-LOOP TO TRUE        *> Exit loop
            END-IF
          END-IF
        END-IF
      END-PERFORM  
      .
    1000-EXIT.
      EXIT.  

## How about COBOL SEARCH command?
True.  Array is probably not the best example.  May be I can rewrite 
this whole page and use file processing instead.
